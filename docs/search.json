    "text": "Hello! I’m Mallory.\nI’m currently a senior in statistics at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. In my undergraduate studies, I’ve developed a strong foundation in mathematical statistics and data analysis, which provided the framework for my current interests in data science and machine learning. I hope to continue my education and further explore the ethical implications of algorithm design, more advanced machine learning and statistical methods, and big data analytics.\nI decided to create this website as a space to collect readings and thoughts on my professional interests, as well as somewhere to hold my current resume. Feel free to check out either of those in the tabs above!\nContact: malloryklostermann@outlook.com"
